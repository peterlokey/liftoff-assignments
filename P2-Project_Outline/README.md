# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app will be a Drink Recipe tool for both amateur and professional bartenders. It will consist of a database of user-
submitted recipes that a user can search through to find new recipes. It will also allow users to create a "My Bar" 
list, which will contain all of the ingredients the user has in stock at his or her bar, whether it is an actual 
business or just the home-bar of an avid cocktail aficionado. Users can then search for new recipes based on the 
ingredients currently in stock in their bar, and also select a specific number of extra ingredients not currently stocked
that may be included in the search results. 
The idea for this app came from my many years of working as a professional bartender. When I began bartending, I 
used existing apps to learn new recipes and found them to be glitchy, inaccurate, and just generally unsatisfactory.
My app will allow users to create an account so the list they build in the "My Bar" section can be saved for later use,
whereas most current sites require a user to rebuild this list every time they revisit the site. My app will be more 
also be more social-media-based than other apps that currently exist, and will allow users to interact with others' 
drink recipes in the form of comments, ratings, and favorite drink lists. This social aspect of the app will create a 
more accurate drink database as users can provide suggestions to other users' drink submissions. This interaction
will help create an online community of people with similar interests sharing their knowledge with one another. 
 
### Features
User login: Users will create an account in order to create a profile page, post new drinks, comment or rate others'
    recipes, and create a "My Bar" list

    comments
Basic Search: Users can search for drinks by name, drink type, and main ingredient
Advanced Search: Logged-in users can search for drinks based on the ingredients contained within their "My Bar" list. 
    Users can also select a number of ingredients not currently stocked in "My Bar" to search for drinks that will
    only require the purchase of a specified number of extra ingredients.
Commenting: Logged-in users can leave questions or tips for other users in the Comments section on each drink recipe
Rating: Logged-in users can rate drink recipes with a 10-star rating system
Favorites: Logged-in users can "Favorite" recipes to build a list of favorites which will be viewable by other users
